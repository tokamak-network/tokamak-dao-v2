### Testing Proposals (Time Travel)

In the local environment, the Voting Period is set to **1 day** (7,200 blocks) instead of the production default of **7 days**. The Voting Delay is also **1 day** (7,200 blocks).

1. Create a proposal, then skip the Voting Delay (1 day) to begin voting:
    
    ```
    npm run time-travel -- 1d
    ```
    
2. Cast your vote in the UI (For / Against / Abstain).
3. Skip the Voting Period (1 day) to close voting:
    
    ```
    npm run time-travel -- 1d
    ```
    
4. Queue and execute the proposal.
